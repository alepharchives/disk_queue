A small persistent queue implementation.

Basically just appends data to file. When the current file opened
for writing reaches a certain threshold a new one is created and
writes go there.

Files containing consumed (dequeued) entries are garbage collected.

Please look at the testcases for documentation.

Note that all existing files are traversed on startup.
